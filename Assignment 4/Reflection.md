## ðŸ“– What I have Gained ðŸ“–

The information that I have gathered from this talk highlights I-Farmâ€™s innovation as a technological approach to addressing societal issues to food production. By supplying consumers with fresh vegetables, this invention has improved human life and, unintentionally, their health too.


## ðŸ§  Improvements ðŸ§ 

One area of improvement that can actually be made is that it would be better if the person who scheduled this industrial talk to genuinely adhere to the time they specified for the talk. I said this because on the day of the talk, they don't actually start at the time they said they would.

## Others

I would like to visit I-Farm to find out more about the technology that they use to provide fresh vegetables to their customers. Furthermore, I hope that someday in the future I will be able to use the innovations I have made to truly improve human life.
