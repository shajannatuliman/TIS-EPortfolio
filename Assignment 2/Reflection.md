## ðŸ“– What I have Gained ðŸ“–

I now know a little bit more about how the UTM systems operate and how the employees truly collaborate. The office has a fantastic atmosphere, which further supports my theory that a work environment plays a significant role in ensuring that assigned tasks are completed and yield excellent results.


## ðŸ§  Improvements ðŸ§ 

I wish we had more time to look around UTMDigital and have more opportunities to speak with the staff members.

## Others

Visiting the data centre was really exciting because of how confidential it is and because we are the first year to be allowed access, this demonstrates that they want us to observe how they actually work to improve the systems and give their best to us.
