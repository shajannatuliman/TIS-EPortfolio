## ðŸ“– What I Have Gained ðŸ“–

I've learned from this industry talk that there is a wide range of jobs available in the ICT field, making it possible for people with a variety of skill sets to find employment in the field. In addition, I've learned that before beginning our career search, students should always hone their existing skills and even add new skills to an even higher degree because this will open up more career opportunities for them in the future.


## ðŸ§  Improvements ðŸ§ 

The improvement that can be made regarding this industrial talk is that rather than doing it online, how about we hold it in person and set up a booth in UTM where students can learn more about the opportunities available to them when pursuing degrees in computer science.

## Others

In my opinion, this industrial talk really helped me see more clearly what I can do after graduating from UTM.  I also think that more industrial talks should be held, or perhaps even a visit one day, as it has greatly benefited students like me in learning more about the range of careers available in the ICT industry.
