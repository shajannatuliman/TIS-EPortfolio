## ðŸ“– What I have Gained ðŸ“–

The things that I have gained from working on this project is how to work together in a group. This has convinced me that teamwork is crucial to the success of our project and to obtain the best possible outcome.


## ðŸ§  Improvements ðŸ§ 

The improvement that can be made is that I wish more examples could be given to us so that we could compare our work to that of previous seniors to improve the quality of our final product. 

## Others

I hope that one of the design thinking that have been presented by the students can actually be made in the future because I believe that there is some group that actually have a very great idea to improve our life as students.
