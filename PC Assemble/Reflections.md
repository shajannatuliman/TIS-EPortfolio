# REFLECTIONS
# What I Have Gained

I have gained a new knowledge of pc assembling. This helps me explore more components that are in the PC especially the hardware components. Before entering UTM, I had never been given the chance to do this, so now that I have, I feel like I'm becoming closer to my course. 

# Improvement

In my opinion, one way to improve is to assign each of us a PC and have us put it together independently instead of in groups. We will gain more knowledge and have many more opportunities to investigate and become knowledgeable about all the components if we handle this independently.


# Others

The idea that I want to share is that how about we just give the students a piece of paper with all the instructions on it and see how they can do it on their own first, instead of having them assemble the PC with the lab assistant's help. The lab assistant can only assist the students if they are unable to complete the task on their own.
